# Website Technology Final Project

I wrote this code since I wanted to be familiar with website development languages, such as HTML and CSS. It is also my final project for the Website Technology class.

This project is about the general idea of chatbots, from Chatbots' definition to what industry uses Chatbot the most. I also used pastel color and some images to make it more interested for my website.
